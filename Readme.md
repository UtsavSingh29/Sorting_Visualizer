Sorting Visualizer
Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer project! This application uses SDL2 to visually demonstrate how different sorting algorithms work. With this tool, you can observe Bubble Sort and Selection Sort in action, complete with real-time updates and color-coded visualizations.

Features
Bubble Sort Visualization: See how the Bubble Sort algorithm iteratively sorts the array.
Selection Sort Visualization: Watch the Selection Sort algorithm in action, demonstrating its step-by-step sorting process.
Interactive UI: Control the sorting process with buttons and reset the array as needed.
Color Coding: Distinguish between different states of the array elements:
Red: Unsorted elements
Pink: Currently selected element
Blue: Comparing element
Green: Sorted elements
